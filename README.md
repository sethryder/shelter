Shelter
====================

Shelter is a command-line interface for working with Storm On Demand.

Shelter aims at allowing you to perform almost all (if not all) the operations that you can perform in the Storm Management panel.

Shelter is currently under heavy development, so many things may be broken and will most likely change.
